<p><em>Abstract</em>—Workload characterization plays a significant part in driving the design and synthesis of complex computer architectures. It can help identify possible avenues of optimization and direct high level design decisions. In this paper, we examine the distributions of executed instructions, memory requests, and datapath usage illuminating missed opportunities surrounding architecture design.</p>
